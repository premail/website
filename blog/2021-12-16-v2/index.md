Premail version 2.0 is out! Take a look at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/premail) or [GitHub](https://github.com/premail/premail).

Compared to where this started, Premail is a completely new tool with a new name, so this is really more like a v1 of a full-featured tool.

And, transparently, there are still some known bugs. I'm going to try to create [issues](https://github.com/premail/premail/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) for these in the coming days, but I wanted to get a v2 release out the door so that the npm package could be properly updated.

More to come!
