Premail includes some
[MJML custom components](https://documentation.mjml.io/#creating-a-component)
for common use cases:

- **[MJML Bullet List](/docs/components/mjml-bullet-list/)**
- **[MJML Signoff](/docs/components/mjml-signoff/)**

You do not need to do anything to enable these in your Premail project. They are
made available with the included `.mjmlconfig` file.
