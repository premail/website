Look at the
[`config.yaml`](https://github.com/premail/premail/blob/v2.0.0/src/example/config.yaml)
file at the root of your project you created.

Here you'll find options for setting the names of your `designs` and `emails`
directories, which will hold individual designs and emails, respectively. You
can also change the name of the primary template file (`index.hbs`, by default).

Under "Email-building options," you'll see preferences you can set on the
rendered emails such as whether to generate a plain-text version.
