Look at the
[`premail.yaml`](https://github.com/premail/premail/blob/main/src/example/premail.yaml)
file at the root of your project you created.

Here you'll find options for setting the names of your `designs` and `emails`
directories, which will hold individual designs and emails, respectively, and
the subdirectory where you want compiled emails to be saved.
